                <p>The global waste disposal crisis is a pressing challenge caused by rapid urbanization, population growth, and consumerism. Re-Bot is a next-generation robotic system designed to revolutionize waste management by combining automation, advanced sensors, and financial incentives. By promoting efficient waste segregation and recycling, Re-Bot addresses critical environmental, social, and economic issues.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Re-Bot is a self-sufficient robotic mechanism that leverages automation, cutting-edge sensors, and a financial reward framework to transform waste management. By eliminating inefficiencies in waste segregation and recycling, Re-Bot achieves a segregation accuracy of 95% compared to 70% using traditional methods. The mobile app connects the waste handled by users to instant monetary benefits, resulting in a 98% success rate and a 60% rise in public engagement. During its deployment, Re-Bot diverted 65% of waste from landfills, amounting to 4.5 tonnes, and increased recycling rates from 30% to 78%. This innovation contributes to better recycling practices, sustainability, and tangible environmental and economic value.</p>
